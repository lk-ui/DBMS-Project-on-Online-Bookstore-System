# DBMS-Project-on-Online-Bookstore-System
This project creates an online bookstore system using the concept of databases,HTML,CSS and JSP.
Several tables have been created in this database to this end.
The tables are updated regularly based on the new user registration or when admin exercises his privileges and makes changes in the database.
The cart contents and wishlist are cleared after every purchase.
